	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
In this part, you will work in teams to develop basic neighbor discovery capabilities to each node. The goals
of this first part are to become familiar with the ns-3 development environment and understand the skeleton
code. Before you write any code, make sure you read in detail the code documentation, understand the API
and structure of the relevant parts of the ns-3 code.
	</div>
	
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">	
		All your code should go inside the <b>cs433</b> directory and you should not modify other files in the ns-3
directory. Your assignment is to modify the file ls-routing-protocol.cc and dv-routing-protocol.cc in order
to support neighbor discovery. Note that you are free to add new packet types to ls-message.cc and dv-
message.cc. Feel free to structure your own code, for instance, introduce your own helper files, or have one
neighbor discovery module shared by both LS and DV.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
	<b>Neighbor Discovery</b>. Your node continuously probes the network at a low rate to discover its immediate
neighbors in the network topology. Again, you devise a solution within these constraints:
	</div>
	<br>	
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
You may add additional packet types, e.g. periodic broadcast "hello" message on all outgoing interfaces
to neighboring nodes to inform them of the nodes presence. For each "hello" message, neighboring
nodes respond with a "hello reply" message with their IP addresses. The TTL of the broadcast message
has to be set to 1, to avoid flooding the message to entire network.
<br><br>
	Neighbors disappear as well as appear (as specified in the scenario file or via the interactive command
line). You will want to print out the current list of neighbors so you can see who they are, perhaps
only printing when there is a change.<br><br>
As a tip, you will need to use timers to implement continuous, low-rate background activity. Be
very careful with automated mechanisms, especially when using flooding and broadcast! They should
operate on the timescale of at least tens of seconds (tens of thousands of milliseconds in the API calls!).<br><br>

Add the following command to your node: "DUMP NEIGHBORS" to dump a list of all of the neighbors
to which your node believes it is currently connected. Each neighbor entry should include (neighbor
node number, neighbor IP address, interface). Please see the code documentation for the exact commands.
<br><br>
<b>Hint</b>. It is probably simplest to implement these functions in the order they are given above.

	<h1 class="maincontentStyleH">Part 2</h1>

	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
Your assignment is to extend your node to support efficient routing by implementing two protocols: link-state
(45%) and distance-vector routing (40%). If your implementation works, you will be able to route packets
hop-by-hop through the network, having packets propagate through a path, only involving nodes enroute to
the destination.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
		<b>2.1 Link-state routing</b><br>
Your node must implement link-state routing to construct a routing table, and use this routing table to
forward packets towards their destination. You may read more about link-state routing in Section 4.2.3 of
[1]. Note that we are not implementing OSPF, but a different and simpler link-state protocol. The link-state
protocol generally involves four steps:


	</div>	
	<br>	
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp	<b>Neighbor discovery</b>. To determine your current set of neighbors. You will use the neighbor discovery
		code that you built in Part 1.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp <b>Link-state flooding</b>. To tell all nodes about all neighbors. You will have to implement flooding code
that uses the neighbor table that you build in part 1 to disseminate link-state packets. Your flooding
protocol should not result in infinite packet loops or unnecessary duplicate packets (i.e. a node should
not forward a link-state packet it has seen previously, or has seen a more recent one). A key design
choice is whether to send out a LinkState packet periodically or immediately after the neighbor list
changes. A key design criterion is to distribute link state information using as few packets as possible,
while keeping nodes as up to date as possible.<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<b>Shortest-path</b> calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm. To build and keep up-to-date a routing table
that allows you to determine the next-hop to forward a packet towards its destination. The least-cost
route is the one with the fewest hops.<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp <b>Forwarding</b>. To send packets using the next-hops.
	</div><br>
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
		Some basic guidelines<br>
 	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 1. See the details in [1] for a good suggestion on how to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. The result of this
algorithm should be a routing table containing the next-hop neighbor to send to for each destination
address.<br>
 	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 2.  You should forward packets using the next-hop neighbors in your calculated routing table. The excep-
tion is packets sent to the network broadcast address (e.g., for neighbor discovery or sending link state
information); these should be flooded. Note that when your node receives a packet, it may perform
one of three actions: (1) if the packet is destined for the node, it will “deliver” the packet locally; (2) if
the packet is destined for another node, it will “route” the packet; (3) if the packet is destined for the
broadcast address, it will both deliver packet locally, and continue flooding the packet (while avoiding
infinite loops).<br>
  	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 3. Add a command to your node: ”DUMP ROUTES” to dump the contents of the routing table. You
may find this more convenient than logging the entire routing table after every change. Note that
this command is already in the skeleton code, and you need to find the function that corresponds to
this command and modify it accordingly. Each routing table entry should contain (destination node
number, destination IP address, next hop node number, next hop IP address, interface, cost).<br>
</div>
<br>
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
Once you have completed all of the above, you should be able to ping any other node (by node number) in
the network, and have a packet travel to that node and back without being unnecessarily flooded throughout
the network. To see that your protocol is working, we have provided an example test scenario. (Read Section
4 of code documentation for details.) For your own testing purposes, you might want to set up a small ring
network, use ping to test whether you can reach remote nodes, and then break reachability by stopping a
node on the path so that ping no longer receives a response. Your routing protocol should detect this and
repair the situation by finding an alternative path. When it does, ping will work again. Congratulations!
You have a real, working network!

	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
		<b>2.2 Distance-vector routing</b><br>
The second routing protocol you have to implement is the distance-vector routing protocol. Your solution
should address the count-to-infinity problem by bounding the distance to a maximum of 16 hops. Note that
we are not implementing the entire RIP protocol, but a simple distance vector routing protocol that consists
of the following four steps:

	</div>	
	<br>	
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp	<b>Neighbor discovery</b>. You will use the neighbor discovery code that you built in Part 1.
		<br>
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp	<b>Distance-vector exchange</b>. Each node periodically sends its distance-vector to all its neighbors.
		<br>
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp	<b>Route calculation</b>. Based on the vectors received from each neighbor, each node computes a routing
table similar to the above link-state protocol.
		<br>
	&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp	<b>Forwarding</b>. To send packets using the next-hops, similar to the link-state protocol.
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
	For this protocol, we will leave the actual implementation more open-ended to allow for your creativity.
	Use the same command DUMP ROUTES to dump the table of distance vector. The routing table has the
	same format as that of link-state.
	<br><br>
	Given a similar network of diameter less than 16, your distance-vector protocol implementation should
	compute next hops with the same shortest path costs as your link-state protocol. Similar to the link-state
	protocol, all your code should go inside the cs433 directory.

	<h1 class="maincontentStyleH">Part 3 (Extra Credits)</h1>
	<br>
	<div class="maincontentStyleP">
This part is entirely optional. We recommend that you only start working on extra credits after you have
finished the regular credits. <br><br>
Here are some example extra credits that you can implement. For extra credit, you are responsible for
providing your own test cases and design documents:<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<b>Path vector protocol</b> (5%). Similar to distance vector protocol, except that complete paths are
advertised. To avoid the count-to-infinity problem, cycles must be explicitly checked.
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp <b>Hazy sighted link state (HSLS)</b> (15%). HSLS is another variant of Link State routing for mobile
ad-hoc networks. You can search online to read up more on this protocol. To get the full 15% credit,
you need to demonstrate a working implementation running an actual mobile ad-hoc network (i.e.
replace our current pt-to-pt network with an ns-3 MANET setup).
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp<b>Delay tolerant networking</b> (15%). Implement summary-based epidemic routing protocol. Demon-
strate actual implementation in a highly disconnected wireless network where nodes are connected to
each other infrequently.<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp<b>Metric-based link-state protocol</b> (10%). Instead of computing routes based on fewest hop count,
allow routes to be selected based on link metrics (e.g. lower loss rates, lower latency, higher bandwidth
are all reasonable choices). Your design can and should make use of the facilities defined above (link
state advertisements). Link metrics should be syntactically generated (either by writing your own
generator or modifying the Inet topology generator), which you have to import into our simulator.
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp<b>Incremental Djkstra computation</b> (10%). Given a route update, instead of recomputing Djkstra
from scratch for all entries, perform incremental recomputation that only updates routes relevant to the
shortest path. To demonstrate working implementation, you need to demonstrate that your simulation
can run significantly faster for the same network size (while computing the correct routes of course!).
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp<b>Your proposal</b> (X%). If you have a cool extension in mind, feel free to contact the teaching fellow to
discuss feasibility and points awarded.
